title: Notify repository automatically about new resources
draft: false
description: "As a repository manager, I want my repository to be automatically notified about new or modified relevant objects and metadata, so that I can have a more complete and accurate collection. I also want other, remote systems to be notified of changes made to my collection​ ​to​ ​ensure​ ​that​ ​records​ ​are​ ​standardized​ ​across​ ​various​ ​locations."
