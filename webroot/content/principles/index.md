# Guiding Principles

The next generation repositories work is based on the following principles:

### Distribution of control 
Distributed control, or governance, of scholarly resources (pre-prints, post-prints, research data, supporting software, etc.) and scholarly infrastructures is an important principle which underpins this work. Without this, a small number of actors can gain too much control and can establish a quasi-monopolistic position. Distributed networks are more sustainable and at less risk to buy-out or failure.

### Inclusiveness and diversity
Different institutions and regions have unique and particular needs and contexts (e.g diverse language, policies and priorities). A distributed network of repositories will aim to reflect and be responsive to the different needs and contexts of different regions, disciplines and countries.

### Public good
The technologies, architectures and protocols adopted in the context of the global network for repositories will be available to everyone, using global standards when they are available.

### Intelligent openness and accessibility
Scholarly resources will be made openly available and in accessible formats, whenever possible, in order increase their value and maximize their re-use for the benefit for scholarship and society.

### Sustainability
Institutions and research organizations will be major participants in the global network, contributing to the long term sustainability of resources.

### Interoperability
Repositories will adopt common behaviours, functionalities and standards ensuring interoperability across institutions and enabling them to engage in a common way with external service providers
