### WebID

WebID is an HTTP(S) URI which refers to an agent (person, organization, group, etc.) and that is minted in a domain that is typically owned by the agent. The WebID leads to a machine-readable profile that describes the agent. The RDF-based profile is fully under the agentâ€™s control and uses the FOAF vocabulary. A WebID is commonly used in conjunction with the WebID/TLS authentication approach [see behaviour Authentication of Users] and the Web Access Control Lists authorization approach. https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/
