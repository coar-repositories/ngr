### HTTP Signatures

HTTP Signatures provide an authentication approach that is conceptually similar to WebID/TLS. But the approach is more generic in that it is not solely tied to the WebID concept. Also, in addition to authentication, it allows verification that the communication between client and server was not tampered with. The approach is currently being standardized at the IETF and is definitely something to keep an eye on in the authentication space. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cavage-http-signatures/
