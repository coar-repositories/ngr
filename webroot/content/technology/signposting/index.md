### Signposting

Signposting is an approach to inform machine agents about the nature of the resources that are linked from the resource they currently interact with. It uses typed links (in the HTTP Link header, the HTML <link> element, or the <rs:ln> ResourceSync element) to reveal patterns that occur repeatedly in scholarly portals. Signposting can be used to support automatic discovery of a variety of resources that pertain to a scholarly object, including a bibliographic description, a persistent identifier, a license, authors, or various resources that are part of the object. http://signposting.org
