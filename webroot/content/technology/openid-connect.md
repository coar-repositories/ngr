### OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which itself is used for distributed authentication against compliant identity providers. OpenID Connect allows client applications - such as repositories and browsers - to verify a user’s claimed identity by authenticating the user against her identity provider. As a result of a successful authentication, basic profile information about the user can be passed along to the client application. The specification is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management. The major providers of social network identities already support OpenID Connect. ORCID’s implementation is currently in beta. http://openid.net/connect/
