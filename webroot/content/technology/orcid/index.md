### ORCID

ORCID is an HTTP(S) URI in the orcid.org domain aimed at unambiguously identifying a scholarly contributor. ORCIDs are increasingly used in a variety of scholarly workflows. A profile is associated with a contributorâ€™s ORCID, which has both a human and machine readable representation. The machine-readable profile is RDF-based and uses the FOAF vocabulary. The ORCID organization also provides authentication services that can be used in distributed settings. [see behaviour Authentication of Users]. https://orcid.org/
